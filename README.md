<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

> The next key features are availble in this project.

### <b>JWT</b>

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a standard that is contained in the RFC 7519 document.

In it, a mechanism is defined to be able to propagate between two parties, and in a secure way, the identity of a certain user, also with a series of claims or privileges.

These privileges are encoded in JSON-type objects, which are embedded within the payload or body of a message that is digitally signed.

### <b> Token</b>

Is a text string that has three Base64-encoded parts, each separated by a dot

* <b>Header</b>: the algorithm and the type of token are indicated, which in this case we use JWT token.

* <b>Payload</b>: the user data and privileges appear, as well as all the information that we want to add, all the data that we deem convenient.
